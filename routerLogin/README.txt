This package contains ammbr login portal compiled for a openWRT router.

The package provides:

1 A login page to login to browsing session and get internet access using ammbr codes

2 A management portal for owner of the router to check internet usage and ammbr tokens accumulated

NoDogSplash is modified to be used as captive portal for ammbr login.

This package is independent of router configuration and management console provided by luci. This package manages only browsing session login for internet access
